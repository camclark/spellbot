>  You can also change the number of players from the default of four by using, for example, `!play size:2` to create a two player game.
> 
> Up to five tags can be given as well. For example, `!play no-combo proxy` has two tags: `no-combo` and `proxy`. Look on your server for what tags are being used by your community members. Tags can **not** be a number like `5`. Be careful when using tags because the matchmaker will only pair you up with other players who've used **EXACTLY** the same tags.
> 
> You can also specify a power level like `!play power:7` for example and the matchmaker will attempt to find a game with similar power levels for you. Note that players who specify a power level will never get paired up with players who have not, and vice versa. You will also not be matched up _exactly_ by power level as there is a fudge factor involved.
> 
> If your server's admins have set the scope for your server to "channel", then matchmaking will only happen between other players who run this command in the same channel as you did. The default scope for matchmaking is server-wide.
