`!play [@mention-1] [@mention-2] [...] [size:N] [power:N] [tag-1] [tag-2] [...]`
>  Enter a play queue for a game on SpellTable.
> 
> You can get in a queue with a friend by mentioning them in the command with the @
> character. You can also change the number of players from the default of four by
> using, for example, `!play size:2` to create a two player game.
> 
> Up to five tags can be given as well. For example, `!play no-combo proxy` has
> two tags: `no-combo` and `proxy`. Look on your server for what tags are being
> used by your community members. Tags can **not** be a number like `5`. Be careful
> when using tags because the matchmaker will only pair you up with other players
> who've used **EXACTLY** the same tags.
> 
> You can also specify a power level like `!play power:7` for example and the
> matchmaker will attempt to find a game with similar power levels for you. Note
> that players who specify a power level will never get paired up with players who
> have not, and vice versa. You will also not be matched up _exactly_ by power level
> as there is a fudge factor involved.
> 
> If your server's admins have set the scope for your server to "channel", then
> matchmaking will only happen between other players who run this command in the
> same channel as you did. The default scope for matchmaking is server-wide.
