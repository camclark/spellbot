>  Get information about SpellBot.

`!begin <event id>`
>  Confirm creation of games for the given event id. _Requires the "SpellBot Admin" role._

`!event <player 1 column> <player 2 column> ... <player N column>`
>  Create many games in batch from an attached CSV data file. _Requires the "SpellBot Admin" role._
> 
> For example, if your event is for a Modern tournement you might attach a CSV file with a comment like `!event Player1Username Player2Username`. This would assume that the players' discord user names are found in the "Player1Username" and "Player2Username" CSV columns. The game size is deduced from the number of column names given, so we know the games created in this example are `size:2`.

> Games will not be created immediately to allow you to verify things look ok first. After the event is created you will be given directions on how to start it.

`!game [similar parameters as !play] [-- An optional additional message to send.]`
>  Create a game between mentioned users. _Requires the "SpellBot Admin" role._
> 
> Operates similarly to the `!play` command with a few key deferences. First, see that command's usage help for more details. Then, here are the differences:
> * The user who issues this command is **NOT** added to the game themselves.
> * You must mention all of the players to be seated in the game.
> * Optional: Add a message by using " -- " followed by the message content.

`!play [@mention-1] [@mention-2] [...] [size:N] [power:N] [tag-1] [tag-2] [...]`
>  Enter a play queue for a game on SpellTable.

> You can get in a queue with a friend by mentioning them in the command with the @ character. You can also change the number of players from the default of four by using, for example, `!play size:2` to create a two player game.
