>  Enter the queue for a game on SpellTable.
> 
> You can get in the queue with a friend by mentioning them in the command using
> the @ character. You can also change the number of players from the default of
> four by using, for example, `!play size:2` to create a two player game.
> 
> Up to five tags can be given as well. For example, `!play power:10 proxy` shows
> two tags: `power:10` and `proxy`. Check with your server for what tags are being
> used. Tags can not be just a number and must be no longer than 50 characters. Be
> careful when using tags because the matchmaker will only pair you up with other
> players who use *EXACTLY* the same tags that you used.
> 
> If your server's admins have set the scope for your server to "channel", then
> matchmaking will only happen between other players who run this command in the
> same channel as you did. The default scope is server wide.
